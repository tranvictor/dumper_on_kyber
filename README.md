# dumper_on_kyber
Bear market is making me homeless, dumping token on kyber for food is pure joy...

# Prerequisites:
1. Go 1.10 or newer
2. Your address should already allow Kyber's network contract with high allowance on the token you want to dump

# How to use
1. Modify `main.go` in `main function` to tweak token and parameters. It is self-explained, no need docs.
2. Compile it `go build -v -o dumper`
3. Run it `./dumper <path to your keystore>`
4. Jure joy watching it runs
